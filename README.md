Geophysical information, material, and example codes for use with the Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) field camp.

**Abstract**

The goal of this book is to provide material for students to help guide them through understanding the basics of geophysical methods including the physics, instrumentation, field methods, processing, modeling and interpretation.

## Methods

The methods covered are:

:::{table} Geophysical Methods
:label: gp_methods
:align: center

| Potential Fields | Electromagnetics | Seismic | Electrical |
| :--------------: | :--------------: | :-----: | :--------: |
| Gravity | Magnetotellurics (MT) | Reflection  | Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) |
| Magnetics | Transient Electromagnetics (EM) | Refraction | |
| Thermal | Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) | Near-surface | |

:::



- Gravity
- Magnetics
- Electromagnetics
  - Magnetotellurics
  - Transient Electromagnetics (TEM)
  - Ground-penetrating Radar (GPR)
- Electrical
  - ERT
- Thermal
  - DTS
- Seismic
  - Passive seismic
  - Active seismic

Each method will start with `Key Concepts` that by the end of going through each module you should be able to understand.  Example Python example code for working with various data sets is provided. For extra information links to external resources as well.

# Key Concepts

1. **Physical understanding**: 

2. **Measurements**: 

3. **Field Deployment**: Understand survey design and instrument deployment.
    - **Survey Design**: Understand the basics of survey design starting from a geologic target.
    - **Instrument Deployment**: Understand basic instrument deployment/

4. **Processing/Modeling**: Get exposure to how data are processed, modelled.
    - **Processing**: 
    - **Modeling**: 

5. **Interpretation**: Assimilate geologic knowledge with geophysical models
    - **Rock Properties**: Think about various rock properties and how that might affect density
    - **Combined with Geology**: Explore ways to interpret density models starting with geology.

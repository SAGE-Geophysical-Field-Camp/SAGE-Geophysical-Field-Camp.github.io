    "# How To Contribute\n",
    "\n",
    "This online book is developed using [MyST](https://mystmd.org/), which renders MyST markdown and Jupyter notebooks into a web accessible format.  Therefore the way to create content is to either compose a markdown document (`.md`) or a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file and then add it to the `myst.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating MyST markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "`MyST` markdown is more extensible than Markdown and is focused on scientific writing.  For more information see [MyST](https://mystmd.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow detailed text along with executable code.  This provides students with a lot of information and interactivity.  For more information on Jupyter notebooks see [Jupyter Documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Material\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created material you'll want to add it to the rendered material.  To do this open up the `myst.yml` found in the repository and add your file or folder to the table of contents `toc` part. Indentation is important.  You can see from the example below the pattern is a section is `title: section name` then `children` which will include various types of files or other.  Then a sub-section will have a similar patter, just with a further indentation. \n",

    "\n",
    "All markdown and Jupyter notebooks are stored in the [SAGE-Geophysical-Field-Camp Git repository]( https://github.com/SAGE-Geophysical-Field-Camp/SAGE-Geophysical-Field-Camp.github.io).  This helps keep the files organized as well as version controlled.  Moreover, upon a commit is pushed a `Git Action` will be triggered to render the website https://sage-geophysical-field-camp.github.io. \n",

    "If you are new to `git` checkout [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). \n",

    "### Members\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a member you have access to commit, push, and pull using `git`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-members\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not a member then you can `fork` the repository to your own `GitHub` account, make changes, and then create a `pull request` back into the `main` branch of the repository.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important steps to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Always `pull` before `push` to make sure you are using the latest version of the repository\n",
    " - Be cautious if you are committing large amounts of information.  Suggest using a `pull request` for big changes or large updates to the material.\n",
    " - Commit often when making changes, this not only keeps a record of changes, but if something breaks or you want to `revert` back to an older version its much easier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "A `pull request` is request to add code to a certain branch of the original repository, in this case it will be the `main` branch. In the `pull request` (`PR`), be sure to add information about what was changed or added so that maintainers know what they are merging. For example,  \n",
    "\n",
    " - If you are adding exectuble code, was a test added to make sure the code runs properly?\n",
    " - Did you add documentation, information material, or other?\n",
    " - How will the update benefit the material?\n",
